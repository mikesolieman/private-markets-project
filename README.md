## Dataset Used
This dataset from Maven Analytics contains stats on private companies with a valuation of more than $1 billion. It contains a csv table with 1,074 records, one for each company. Each record contains details on the company's current valuation, total funding, country of origin, industry, select investors, and the years they were founded and became unicorns. 

## Tools Used
Leveraged Python's Pandas libaray to ingest data in raw format and transform this data into the proper format for analysis.
